## Introductions
1. Name, pronouns, background, winter break

    My name is Lilan. I go by she/her pronoun. I'm an artist and experimental filmmaker with design and coding background. Last year I graduated from Rhode Island School of Design with a master of fine arts in Digital + Media. Before that I studied computer engineering for my undergrad and worked as a design researcher and consultant for a while. During winter break I was visiting friends in the South, Hilton Heads Island in South Carolina and Atlanta, Georgia.

2. Casual presentation (background. Why CD? Some of previous work. How you spent your winter break?)

2. Syllabus

## Set up Environment

1. Download VS Code
2. Set up GitHub account
3. Download GitHub Desktop


## File Management and Terminals

Before starting, ask what operating system is everyone on? Show of hands on Windows... I'm doing demonstrations on Mac but if you're on Windows is fine too - VS Codes can open terminal.

### Operating Systems

Computer operating systems such as MacOS originated from UNIX, and everything in UNIX is either a file or a process.

- A process is an executing program identified by a unique process identifier

- A file is a collection of data; created by users using text editors.
Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process.

- Any document is a file.

- Program is not a file. It's more like a process. Take Figma as example

- All files are grouped together in the directory structure.

- The file system is arranged in hierarchical structure like an inverted tree.

- The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called root (written as a slash /)

## Basic Command Lines

### Terminal

Terminal is an interface that let you access command lines. 

- $ (dollar sign) is a little technique that people use to indicate this line of code is supposed to be run on the bash command line

- % (percent sign) is similar but for zsh prompt, also called z shell, it's built off of bash, with additional features such as plug-in support, better customization, theme support, spelling correction, etc.

### Navigating

`$ pwd` - prints the absolute path of the current directory

`$ ls` - lists contents in the current directory

`$ cd` - change directory to appointed directory

`$ cd ..` - navigate to parent directory

### Creating, Moving and Deleting

`$ mkdir` - creates a new empty directory

`$ touch` - creates a new empty file

`$ mv` - move a file or directory source to file or directory destination

`$ cp` - copy a file source to directory destination

`$ cp -r` - copy a directory source to directory destination

`$ rm` - removes a file

`$ rm -r` - removes a directory

### Random Terminal Commands

`$ clear` - clears terminal history

`$ users` - gets the current users

`$ whoami` - shows username

`$ env` - gets all info about the environment 

`$ cal` - shows calendar

`$ date` - shows today’s date

`$ exit` - exits terminal

`$ curl http://wttr.in/` - get weather forecast

`$ nc towel.blinkenlights.nl 23` - plays Star Wars VI: A New Hope in Terminal


Many more cool tricks for you to find out...

## GitHub and Git

1. Create a new repository with same name as account name
   
    > github account name: lilanyang
    >
    > repo name: lilanyang.github.io

2. Create a new file `index.html` 

3. Create a new directory called images

4. Download a random image online and save it in the images folder

5. Open VS Code and open the folder for the GitHub repo

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Week 1 Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <img src="images/img.jpg" alt="An image">
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration tells the web browser which version of HTML is being used

- `<html>` element is the container for all the other elements on the page.

- `<head>` element contains meta information about the document, such as the title, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

- `<body>` element contains the visible content of the web page.

- `<h1>` and `<p>` elements are used to create headings and paragraphs, respectively.

- `<img>` element is used to embed images. The src attribute specifies the URL of the image file, and the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.

6. Stylize the webpage

    Create another folder called css and a file called `styles.css`

    Edit the css file

    ```css
    body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    }

    h1 {
    color: #333;
    font-size: 2em;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0.5em;
    text-align: center;
    }

    p {
    color: #555;
    font-size: 1.2em;
    line-height: 1.5em;
    margin: 1em 0;
    padding: 0;
    }

    img {
    max-width: 100%;
    }
    ```

    Link the CSS file by using `<link>` tag and place it inside the header file

    ```html
    <header>
        ...
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
    </header>
    ```

7. Deploy the website

```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "I can type in any comment"
$ git push origin master
```

`$ git add --all`


7. Other Git Commands

`$ git init` creates a new git repository

`$ git clone https://github.com/lilanyang/lilanyang.github.io.git` checkout the repository that can be hosted as a GitHub Pages


## Core 1 Skills Assessment Test

**DUE: Friday, Feb 3, 9:00AM**

Fill out the questionnaire by answering the following questions and post your responses on Canvas:

1. Use a paragraph to describe your previous experience with coding? (What classes have you taken related to HTML/CSS/JavaScript? Or any other coding languages?)

2. What excites you about learning to code?

3. How do you think coding fits into the communication design curriculum, and career after college?

6. What text editors have you used before? And what’s your favorite coding tool in general?

7. Have you used GitHub prior to this class? Describe your understanding of GitHub in one sentence.

8. Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
